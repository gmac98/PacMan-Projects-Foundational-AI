Project 1: Search

Implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

Project 2: Multiagent Adversarial Search

Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.

Project 3: Reinforcement Learning

Implement Value Function, Q learning, and Approximate Q learning to help pacman and crawler agents learn rational policies.

Project 4: Bayes Nets and HMMs

Pacman uses probabilistic inference on Bayes Nets and the forward algorithm and particle sampling in a Hidden Markov Model to find ghosts given noisy readings of distances to them.
